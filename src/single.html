            <h2>Comparing training, validation, and test sets</h2>
            <p>Let’s overview the differences between training, validation, and test sets. All of these datasets have
                their own distinctive roles in the life cycle of a machine learning model.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>The training set is primarily employed in the initial training phase</b> – it’s used to teach the
                    model patterns and behaviors embedded in the dataset.</li>
                <li><b>In contrast, the validation set helps fine</b> -tune the model after the initial training phase
                    by adjusting hyperparameters, detecting and correcting overfitting issues during training.</li>
                <li><b>Finally, the test set is reserved for the final stage of the ML process:</b> it helps evaluate
                    how well the model performs in real-world scenarios by providing an unbiased assessment of its
                    generalization capabilities in terms of new data.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                While these sets have their differences, they also share some common points, especially regarding the
                indispensable role they all play throughout the machine learning process. All three sets are usually
                extracted from a single initial dataset via data splitting. <br>
                Training, validation, and test sets are essential for developing, refining, and assessing the model to
                ensure effective learning, correct generalization, and consistent performance across unseen situations.
                Maintaining the integrity and coherence of these datasets is critical as they collectively contribute to
                creating a well-rounded machine learning model.

                        <p>In the world of machine learning (ML) datasets play a fundamental role in building, training,
                            and validating models. These data collections are not just assortments of information – they
                            are carefully curated sets that fuel the algorithm learning process. Essentially, they serve
                            as the foundation from which insights are derived, patterns are discerned, and predictions
                            are generated.</p>
